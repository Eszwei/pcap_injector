# pcapSteg

pcapStego is a simple CLI tool for creating IPv6 network covert channels within a .pcap file. The modified .pcap can be then used for simulations, create datasets or be lively replayed on a network via tools like [Tcpreplay](https://tcpreplay.appneta.com). 

It consists of two mode:
- interactive mode, which allows the user to manually establish the covert channel choosing the flow to inject, the secret and the injection mechanism.
- bulk mode, which enables the automatization of the entire process, combining multiple secrets and injection mechanisms at once.

Each mode consists of two Python scripts that allows the injection and the extraction processes 

%the ```injector.py```, which allows the injection of a payload in a given field of a flow, and the ```extractor.py```, which is able to extract the payload from a given field of a flow.

# Background

A network covert channel is a hidden communication path laying within a network conversation (see, [here](https://github.com/cdpxe/Network-Covert-Channels-A-University-level-Course/blob/master/README.md) for a crash-course on network information hiding). pcapStego can be used to transmit an arbitrary string/content via a network covert channel targeting IPv6 traffic. Supported injections mechanisms allow to embed information in: 

- Flow Label (20 bit/packet)
- Traffic Class (8 bit/packet)
- Hop Limit (1 bit/packet)

Even if network covert channels can be used for licit purposes, e.g., to enforce privacy and to protect sources in investigative journalism, they are mainly exploited by malware to conceal its presence. Specifically, covert channels are regularly used to exfiltrate data, orchestrate attacks, retrieve malicious payloads and support several steps of the cyber kill chain. To this aim, pcapStego comes with two "databases" of attacks that can be used to simulate the transfer of various malicious entities. Specifically:

- fileless.db: contains several samples of file-less malware that can be injected in the .pcap to simulate the transmission of a threat via a covert channel;

- payload.db. contains several samples of malicious payloads (both obfuscated and clean) that can be injected in the .pcap for simulating a multi-stage loading architecture.  

Commands and payload are took from [FCL](https://github.com/chenerlich/FCL) repository.

# Dependencies
Two libraries are necessary to work with pcapSteg.
- Scapy:
```pip3 install scapy```
- Pandas:
```pip3 install pandas```


# Basic Usage
Let's take a look at the parameters of the ```injector.py``` script for the interactive mode: 
```
$ python3 injector.py [-h HELP] [-r PCAP] [-f FIELD] [-a ATTACK] 
```
The three mandatory parameters represent: 
- ```-r PCAP``` it specifies the .pcap file to read and inject.
- ```-f FIELD``` it specifies the target field to exploit. The available fields are: Flow Label (FL), Traffic Class (TC) and Hop Limit (HL).
- ```-a ATTACK``` it specifies the attack to inject. It can be either a txt file or a string.

Instead, its counterpart the ```extractor.py``` script: 
```
$ python3 extractor.py [-h HELP] [-r PCAP] [-f FIELD] [-p PACKETS] [-b BITS] [-i IMAGE]
```
The three mandatory parameters represent: 
- ```-r PCAP``` it specifies the .pcap file to read and parse.
- ```-f FIELD``` it specifies the target field to inspect. The available fields are: Flow Label (FL), Traffic Class (TC) and Hop Limit (HL).
- ```-p PACKETS``` it specifies the number of packets to extract.
- ```-b BITS``` it specifies the number of bits to extract. It is strongly recommendend in the case of the 20-bit Flow Label field, otherwise is optional.
- ```-i IMAGE``` it specifies whether to extract an image.

Similar commands are used for the bulk mode:  
```
$ python3 injector_bulk.py [-h HELP] [-r PCAP] [-a ATTACK] 
```
The two parameters represent: 
- ```-r PCAP``` it specifies the .pcap file to read and inject.
- ```-a ATTACK``` it specifies a .txt file containing multiple attacks. It is formatted in the following form: [FIELD], [ATTACK].

The extraction process takes advantage of the .csv generated by the injection:
```
$ python3 extractor_bulk.py [-h HELP] [-r PCAP] [-i INJECTED-CSV]
```
The two parameters represent: 
- ```-r PCAP``` it specifies the .pcap file to read and parse.
- ```-i INJECTED-CSV``` it specifies the .csv generated by the injection that contains all the information of the injected flows.

## Example Usages
```
$ python3 injector.py -r pcap_example.pcap -f TC -a hello_world.txt
```
This command will inject the payload contained in the "cmd.txt" into the Traffic Class field of a flow chosen by the user within the specified pcap.
Each attack is tracked in a csv file for future purposes.

```
$ python3 extractor.py -r TC_a=hello_world.txt_pcap_example.pcap -f TC -p 11
```
This command will extract the Traffic Class values of the first 11 packets of a flow chosen by the user within the specified pcap.

For bulk mode, instead: 
```
python3 injector_bulk.py -r pcap_example.pcap -a attacks.txt
python3 extractor_bulk.py -r attacks.txt_pcap_example.pcap -i injected_flows.csv
```
